make sure that it is rendered
across various devices (mobiles,desktops,tablets...) properly.
initial-scale=1.0 ensures that when loaded, your web page will be rendered at a 1:1 scale, and no zooming will
be applied out of the box.
Add user-scalable=no to the content attribute to disable zooming capabilities on mobile devices as shown below.
Users are only able to scroll and not zoom with this change, and results in your site feeling a bit more like a native
application.
