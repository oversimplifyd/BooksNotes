- Margin requirement is the amount of funds required by a foreign exchange dealer to begin buying or selling a set amount of currency. 

- THe major pairs are the most liquid (Liquid in the sense that they are the most stable econoically and politically). 

- All price movement is due to supply and demand 


CANDLES 

Doji - A doji is a type of candle in which its opening price = its closing price. It marks a weakening tend. 
	
	Dragonify Doji  - This is most significant in an overbought market 
	Gravestone Doji - This is most significant in an oversold market 
	
	Generally, Dojis are warning signals of a possible CHANGE in trend DIRECTION 

HAMMER 
	An hammer is quiet similar to the Doji but unlike the Doji, a hammer has a daily range. 
	
	The potential of the strength of the hammer is dependent on 
	- THE LENGTH of the prior trend 
	- The volume of the daily range. that is the body of the hammer compared with the length of the shadows.
	- fOR A GOOD HAMMER 
		* the length of the shadow must be cnosiderably high 
		* The volume of the body should be considered as well. 

	A hammer can either be an 
	- hammer (Bullish Trend (daily range color: Red Body), Bearish Trend (Daily range color: Green Body)). 

	- inverted hammer (Bullish Trend (daily range color: Green Body), Bearish Trend (Daily range color: Red Body)). 

LONG AND SHORT DAYS 
Long days aer high volume candles with little shadows - They can be relevant to deterine continued trends 
Short days are low volume bodies - This may mean the market is consolidating...

Spinning Tops 
These are candles with long shadows/wicks at both ends with small bodies. 
	Spinning tops are considered NEUTRAL in a sideway market 
	In a trending market with big moves spinning tops can be as relevant as a doji 
	This works especially when spinning tops are followed by some days of Doji 

Marubozu
The marubozy is a candle that does not have a wick and has large volume
	- The black marubozy is the most relevant as it signals 
		- A bearish signal at the top of a topping trend 
		- a warming signal even at the top of a long down trend. Which means prices may be at its peeak. 
		Types of Marubozy 
		- Closing Marubozy 
		- Opening Marubozu


When a trend is slowing it is BEST to stay off the market. 
Three indications for a slowing trend are 
		- dojis 
		- spinning tops 
		- hammers 

SHADOWS 
A good rule of thumb is that the longer the shadow, the more likely it is for the trend/market to reverse. 


REVERSAL PATTERNS 
a WELL ESTABLISHED TREND WILL NOT JUST TURN ON A DIME AND REVERS
It will gradually lose steam which can b spotted using candles

	Note: Most of these formations are strongly significant when they form at a resistant or support levels. 

	- Bearish Engulfing 	2 day formation 
	- Bullish Engulfing 	2 day formation 
	- Hanging Man 		3 day formation  (Indicates a bearish reversal/slow down) That is forms on an up-trending market. 
	- Bullish Piercing Line 2 day formation 
	- Dark cloud Cover 	2 day formation 
	- harami 		2 day formation 
	- Shooting star 	3 day formation (Up trending market) 
	- Evening STAR 		3 day forrmtion (uptrending market) 
	- Morning Star 		3 day formation (downtrending market) 
	- Tweezer bottoms and tops (These should not be traded alone unless accompanied by another reversal pattern


	Bullish				Bearish
	Hanging Man 			Hammer 
	Shooting Star 			Inverted Hammer

Prices drop much faster than they rise. 
It usually takes a little longer for a trend to go bearish to bullish because fear is more stronger an emotion than greed. 


CHart Patterns 

Head and Shoulder Pattern 
	- This is a reversal patttern which occurs at a top-trending market. 
	- formation: two neckts (left and right) a head and a neck line. This formation is complete only when there is a head.

Inverted Head and Shoulder - Same as above but occurs in a downtrend.
